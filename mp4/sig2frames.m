function frames = sig2frames(signal, Nw, No)
% Convert a speech signal to frames using the window and overlap method
% Default window used is a Hamming window.
%
% INPUTS:
% signal: speech signal (a vector)
% Nw: window size in number of samples
% No: overlap size in number of samples
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% frames: Matrix of frames [Nw x Nf]. Each column is a frame of length Nw samples.
% There are Nf such frames. Nf is computed from signal, Nw, and No.
